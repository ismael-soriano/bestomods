# Description
Modpack with all QoL and additions for the base game, all have been tested by me for possible bugs or issues between them, enjoy! :D

> **Do not update any of the mods contained on this pack, as they have not been tested and probably would lead to incompatibilities and issues in the game.**

Installation
---

> **On new version releases, I recommend reinstalling the modpack. Thunderstore fails to remove files that are no longer in a modpack on a profile, which will cause issues for your game.**

### Method 1: Installing from searching the for modpack (recommended):

#### Fresh installation (Thunderstore/R2ModMan):
1. Download the [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) OR [R2ModManager](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) and run the executable.
2. Select Lethal Company as your game, and create a new profile (you can name it anything you want that's memorable).
3. Select the profile, click "Get mods" on the left toolbar. Search for "BestoMods" (by Croquetilla) and install.
4. As the mod is preconfigured, press the "Modded" play button in the top right to launch it right away. You must always launch the game this way if you want to play on a modded instance.

#### Updating (Thunderstore/R2ModMan):
1. Check for an updated version number on the modpack (either through a download icon being present next to BestoMods in your mods list, or by checking the changelog here).
2. DO NOT press update. Instead, delete your current profile and create a new one.
3. Select the profile, click "Get mods" on the left toolbar. Search for "BestoMods" and install. You should now be on the latest version.
